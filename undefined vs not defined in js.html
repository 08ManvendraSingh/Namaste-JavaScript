	<!-- undefined vs not defined in js -->

	<!-- undefined -->
	<!-- js create a global execution context and allocate memory to variables with a placeholder called undefined even before a single line of code is executed -->
	<!-- undefined is like a placeholder which is store untill the variable is assigned some value -->


	<!-- not defined -->
	<!-- if try to access which we have not allocate memory to is called not defined-->

	<script type="text/javascript">
		console.log(a);
		var a=10;
		console.log(a);
		console.log(b);
	</script>


	<!-- Javascript is a loosely typed language -->
	<!-- loosely typed means js does not attaches its variable with any data type -->
	<!-- if initially x is string later on we can put number or boolean in x-->
	<!-- loosely typed language  is also known as weakly type language -->

	<script type="text/javascript">
		var a=2;
		console.log(a);
		a='jonas';
		console.log(a);
