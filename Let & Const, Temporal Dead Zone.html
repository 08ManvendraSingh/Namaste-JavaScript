	<!-- Let & const Temporal dead zone -->

	<!-- Let and const -->
	<!-- Let and const declerations are also hoistied but they are hoistied diffrently from var-->
	<!-- Let and const are hoistied in Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ) -->

	<!-- In case of var they are hoistied and allocate memory in global space  -->

	<!-- In case of let and const they are also hoistied and allocate memory but they are stored in different memory than global-->
	<!-- we can't access this memory space before we can't initialize them-->

	<!-- Temporal Dead Zone ->It is time since when let and const were hoistied till they are initialized.
	The time between hoisting and initialized is known as temporal dead zone. -->

	<!-- Difference between var, let & const -->

	<!-- Var -->
	<!-- We can Create variable using Var keyword -->
	<!-- We can update Var -->
	<!-- we can Redeclared Var-->
	<!-- We can initialize Var at the time of decleration and we can also initialize after decleration  -->

	<!-- Let -->
	<!-- We can Create variable using Let keyword -->
	<!-- We can update Let -->
	<!-- we can't Redeclared Let-->
	<!-- We can initialize Let at the time of decleration and we can also initialize after decleration  -->

	<!-- Const -->
	<!-- We can Create variable using Const keyword -->
	<!-- We can't update Const -->
	<!-- we can't Redeclared Const-->
	<!-- It is compulsary to initialize Const at the time of decleration  -->
